An extension allowing to drastically improve the keyboard-based scrolling experience.

To compute the scrolling movement, we used the solution to the differential equations modeling the motion of a solid when subjected to a gravity-like force and friction thus providing an "organic" feeling when scrolling.

Once the extension is installed, you can use the following shortcuts:
- `j`, `k`: scroll down and up
- `Arrow up` and `Arrow down` to scroll up and down
- Combine with `shift` to scroll faster
